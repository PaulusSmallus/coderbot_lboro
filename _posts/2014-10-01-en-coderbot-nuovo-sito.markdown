CoderBot finally gets a whole new website with all the information required to actually make the robot out of standard, generally available parts.

![make]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/build_hw.jpg)

Check out the CoderBot [Mechanics][coderbot-make-mh] and [Hardware][coderbot-make-hw] documentation for mechanical and electronics assembly instructions.
Check out the CoderBot [Software][coderbot-make-sw] documentation for instructions on installing and configuring the software components.

In the following days, the [Play and learn][projects] section will be enriched with detailed instructions and guides, as well as games and projects tailored for the robot.

[coderbot-make-mh]: {{site.baseurl}}/en/how_to_build_mh.html
[coderbot-make-hw]: {{site.baseurl}}/en/how_to_build_hw.html
[coderbot-make-sw]: {{site.baseurl}}/en/how_to_build_sw.html
[projects]: {{site.baseurl}}/en/projects.html
