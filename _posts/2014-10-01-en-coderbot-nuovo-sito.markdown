CoderBot finally gets a whole new website with all the information required to actually make the robot out of standard, generally available parts.

![make]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/build_hw.jpg)

Check out the CoderBot [Mechanics][coderbot-make-mh] and [Hardware][coderbot-make-hw] documentation for mechanical and electronics assembly instructions.

Check out the CoderBot [Software][coderbot-make-sw] documentation for instructions on installing and configuring the software components.

Many thanks to [Giulia][giuliav] for the logo and graphics!

In the following days, the [Play and learn][projects] section will be enriched with detailed instructions and guides, as well as games and projects tailored for the robot.

We hope this website will foster CoderBot project development and improvement, and that the project itself will become a useful and fun tool for learning.
In order to collect questions, issues and suggestions a [forum dedicato][forum] is now open, please use it as to communicate about the project.
To get updates on the project, subscribe to the [mailing list][contact] and follow it on the [social media][contact].
