The new motor control board (or "hat", in Raspberry PI terms) is finally here.

The board enable the PI to control two motors, either DC via L293D or Servo, and two additional Servos which can be used for different purposes: a robotic crane, to rotate ant tilt the camera or new, yet to be conceived ideas that will be part of the next version of CoderBot, 2.0, currently under development.

The board is compatible with Raspberry PI model A, B, B+ and the very new model B 2 (honestly, it was not yet tested on that one, but we look forward to play with it!).
